General Classification
Rainforests are vast, dense forests situated in tropical regions that experience consistently high levels of rainfall throughout the year. Renowned for their extraordinary biodiversity, rainforests play an essential role in sustaining the Earth’s ecological balance.

Description
Rainforests are found across several continents, including South America, Africa, and Asia. The Amazon rainforest in South America is the largest and most well-known. These ecosystems are critically important, as they support an immense variety of plant and animal life—home to more than half of all known species on Earth.

One of the defining characteristics of rainforests is their lush vegetation, which offers numerous benefits. Many of the plants found in these regions are used in traditional and modern medicine, providing vital resources for human health and wellbeing. Moreover, rainforests help purify the atmosphere by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen, making them key contributors in the fight against climate change.

Despite their importance, rainforests are under severe threat from deforestation. Activities such as logging and the clearing of land for agriculture lead to the destruction of habitats, endangering countless species and exacerbating the effects of global climate change.`;
